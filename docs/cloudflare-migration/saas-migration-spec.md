# CoSpec AI Markdown SaaS Migration Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the migration plan for transforming the CoSpec AI Markdown editor application from its current Docker-based architecture to a cloud-native SaaS platform using Cloudflare services. The new architecture will support a multi-tenant model with organization, project, and user hierarchies.

## 2. Current Architecture

The current CoSpec AI Markdown editor is a containerized application with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React-based web application
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server
- **Storage**: Local file system for Markdown files
- **Deployment**: Docker containers orchestrated with Docker Compose
- **Features**:
  - Tree-structured file browser
  - WYSIWYG Markdown editor
  - File operations (create, read, update, delete)
  - Local directory synchronization

## 3. Target Architecture

### 3.1 Overview

The new SaaS platform will be built on Cloudflare's edge computing and storage services, providing a globally distributed, scalable, and secure solution with the following components:

- **Frontend**: React application deployed on Cloudflare Pages
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with Workers for Platforms
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-compatible serverless database)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible object storage)
- **Authentication**: Cloudflare Access or custom auth with JWT

### 3.2 Multi-Tenant Architecture

The SaaS platform will implement a hierarchical multi-tenant model:

1. **Organization Level**:
   - Represents a company or team
   - Has admin users who can manage projects and members
   - Contains multiple projects
   - Can have organization-wide GitHub settings

2. **Project Level**:
   - Represents a collection of related Markdown documents
   - Can have multiple users with different permission levels
   - Contains multiple documents and folders
