   - Optimize resource usage across tenants
   - Monitor tenant-specific usage and limits

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues during migration, the following rollback plan will be executed:

1. **Immediate Rollback Triggers**
   - Data loss or corruption
   - Extended service unavailability
   - Critical security vulnerabilities

2. **Rollback Process**
   - Revert DNS changes to point to original Docker infrastructure
   - Restore any modified data from backups
   - Communicate status to users

3. **Post-Rollback Analysis**
   - Identify root causes of issues
   - Develop fixes and improvements
   - Create revised migration plan

## Post-Migration Activities

1. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation
   - Create technical documentation
   - Document lessons learned

2. **Training**
   - Train support team on new platform
   - Create user training materials
   - Conduct webinars for key users

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Set up ongoing monitoring
   - Establish maintenance procedures
   - Create incident response plan

## Success Metrics

The success of the migration will be measured by the following metrics:

1. **Technical Metrics**
