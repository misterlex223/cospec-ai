# System Design: User Management Service

## Overview
This document outlines the system design for a user management service that handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.

## Architecture
The system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

### Component: User Service
- Type: Service
- Description: Handles user registration, login, and basic profile management operations. Communicates with the database to store user information securely.

### Component: Authentication Service
- Type: Service
- Description: Manages authentication tokens, password hashing, and user verification. Provides JWT tokens for secure API access.

### Component: Database
- Type: Database
- Description: PostgreSQL database storing user credentials, profiles, and session information. Implements proper encryption for sensitive data.

### Component: API Gateway
- Type: API
- Description: Serves as the entry point for all client requests. Handles rate limiting, request routing, and security policies.

## Data Flow
1. User sends registration request to API Gateway
2. API Gateway forwards to User Service
3. User Service stores data in Database
4. Authentication Service creates JWT token
5. Token is returned to user for subsequent requests

## Security Considerations
- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens have limited expiration
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- HTTPS is enforced for all communications
