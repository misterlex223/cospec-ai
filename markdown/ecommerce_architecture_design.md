## Order Service
- Type: Service
- Description: Processes customer orders, manages order status, and coordinates with payment and inventory services.

## API Gateway
- Type: API

## Data Flow

1. Customer visits frontend application
2. Frontend fetches product data from Product Service via API Gateway
3. Customer adds items to cart and proceeds to checkout
4. Order Service processes order and communicates with Payment Service
5. Payment confirmation triggers inventory update in Product Service
6. Order status updates are communicated to customer

## Scalability Requirements

- System should handle 100,000 daily active users
- Horizontal scaling capability for all services
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Load balancing across multiple instances
